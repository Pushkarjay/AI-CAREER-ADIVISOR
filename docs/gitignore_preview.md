# .gitignore Changes Preview

## Changes Made to .gitignore

### Added Private Credentials Protection
```gitignore
### Private credentials and service accounts (moved to local folder)
/private_credentials_local/
*.key.json
service-account*.json
**/service-account-key.json
**/firebase-admin-key.json
**/*-key.json
**/credentials.json
*.p12
*.pem
auth-users.json
```

### Previous Pattern (Replaced)
```gitignore
### Service Account Keys and Credentials
**/service-account-key.json
**/firebase-admin-key.json
**/*-key.json
**/credentials.json
```

## What These Changes Do

### New Protection Added
- **`/private_credentials_local/`** - Protects the entire local credentials directory
- **`*.key.json`** - Catches any JSON key files
- **`service-account*.json`** - Protects service account files with any naming
- **`*.p12` and `*.pem`** - Protects certificate files
- **`auth-users.json`** - Protects local authentication data

### Enhanced Security
- More comprehensive credential file patterns
- Dedicated local-only directory for sensitive files
- Protection against common credential file extensions
- Backwards compatibility with existing patterns

## Files Currently Protected
Based on the patterns above, these types of files are now ignored:

✅ All files in `/private_credentials_local/` directory  
✅ Service account JSON keys (any naming convention)  
✅ Firebase admin keys  
✅ Certificate files (.p12, .pem)  
✅ Environment files (.env, .env.*)  
✅ Authentication data files  
✅ Any JSON files ending in `-key.json`  

## Verification
To verify the .gitignore is working:
```bash
# Check what files would be committed
git status

# Should NOT show any files from private_credentials_local/
# Should NOT show .env files with secrets
```

These changes ensure sensitive credentials are never accidentally committed to the repository.
