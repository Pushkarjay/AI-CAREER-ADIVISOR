## Git Status Check ✅
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: All moved files properly tracked, sensitive files not staged for commit

### Files Staged for Removal (Expected)
- `auth-users.json` - Moved to private_credentials_local/
- `DEBUG_PRODUCTION.md` - Moved to docs/orphaned-root-files/
- `SELF_LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Moved to docs/orphaned-root-files/
- `deploy-example.yml` - Moved to docs/orphaned-root-files/

### New Files Created (Expected)
- `configs/` directory with example files
- `docs/LOCAL_CREDENTIALS_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `docs/gitignore_preview.md`
- `docs/orphaned-root-files/` directory
- `docs/repo-inventory.md`
- `docs/self-local/` directory with consolidated docs
- `docs/suspected_sensitive_files.md`

### Modified Files (Expected)
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced credential protection
- `README.md` - Added repo organization section

## Credential Protection Check ✅
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: All sensitive files moved to `/private_credentials_local/` (git-ignored)

### Protected Files (Not in Git)
- `ai-career-advisor-id-acd48fa625db.json` - Service account key

- `backend-service-account-key.json` - Backend service account
- `backend.env` - Backend environment variables

## Build Tests
**Status**: SKIPPED  
**Reason**: Missing secrets would cause build failures - expected after credential cleanup

## Documentation Structure Check ✅
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: All temporary docs consolidated into organized structure

### Consolidated Documentation
- Workshop notes moved to `/docs/self-local/`
- Credential instructions created at `/docs/LOCAL_CREDENTIALS_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Example files created in `/configs/`
- Orphaned files moved to `/docs/orphaned-root-files/`

## Security Verification ✅
**Status**: PASSED  
**Details**: .gitignore patterns protect all credential types

### .gitignore Protection Active For:
- Private credentials directory: `/private_credentials_local/`
- Service account keys: `*.key.json`, `service-account*.json`
- Environment files: `.env`, `.env.*`
- Certificate files: `*.p12`, `*.pem`
- Authentication data: `auth-users.json`

## Summary
- ✅ All sensitive files safely moved and protected
- ✅ Git tracking properly updated
- ✅ Documentation consolidated and organized
- ✅ Example files created for developer guidance
- ✅ Security patterns implemented in .gitignore
- ⚠️ Build tests skipped (expected due to missing credentials)

**Overall Status**: READY FOR COMMIT
